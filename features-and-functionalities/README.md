## Ì∂ºÔ∏è Visual Aid

The `features.png` file provides a visual mind map that illustrates how these features are structured and connected within the system.

- **Rounded rectangles** represent each main module.
- **Ellipses** are used to display sub-features within each module.
- The **Admin Dashboard** is positioned at the bottom to emphasize its system-wide visibility and control.
- Vertical dot indicators (`‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢`) show that additional admin-level functionalities are accessible for that module.
