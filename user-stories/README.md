# User Stories Overview

This folder contains the complete user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend project.

User stories are written in the format:

> As a [type of user], I want to [do some action], so that [I achieve a goal].

They are grouped by actor (Guest, Host, Admin) and serve as a guide for implementing backend features and writing API documentation.
